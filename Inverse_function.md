# What is Inverse Function?
> An inverse function goes the other way!

Let us start with an example:

Here we have the function f(x) = 2x+3, written as a flow diagram:

![2x+3](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/images/flow-2xp3.svg)

### The Inverse Function goes the other way:

![Inverse](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/images/flow-2xp3-inv.svg)

So the inverse of:   2x+3   is:   (y-3)/2

 

The inverse is usually shown by putting a little "-1" after the function name, like this:

f-1(y)

We say "f inverse of y"

So, the inverse of f(x) = 2x+3 is written:

f-1(y) = (y-3)/2
